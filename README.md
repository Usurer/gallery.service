# Gallery app backend

The purpose of this application is to serve as an API for the Gallery.

It should provide the endpoints that allow to query for images, located in local folders.

Ideally I would like to have something like Google Photos, maybe without it's AI features.

## Some conventions

For branch names I've decided to use a `GS-` prefix (Gallery Service) i.e. for issue #5 it would be `GS-5`
